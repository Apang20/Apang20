### Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹


My name is Avelon Pang and I am a full-stack software engineer. I'm from Austin, Texas and recently graduated from Flatiron School's full-immersive software engineering bootcamp in March 2021. I have a passion for applying new technologies and Nancy Drew-like skills for technical problem solving! 

With a background in fundraising I was responsible for several high quality non-profit events for the Austin community and I've also collaborated cross-culturally with faculty in English, Spanish and Mandarin while employed as teacher in Taiwan.Iâ€™m excited to combine my years of international work experience with my new skills in Ruby on Rails, Javascript and React to a new opportunity as a developer.
