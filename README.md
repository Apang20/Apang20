### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Avelon Pang and I am a full-stack software engineer. I'm from Austin, Texas and recently graduated from Flatiron School's full-immersive software engineering bootcamp in March 2021. I have a passion for applying new technologies and Nancy Drew-like skills for technical problem solving! 

With a background in fundraising, I mastered skills prioritizing competing tasks under pressure, strong communication, and delivering quality events for the Austin community. I've also collaborated cross-culturally with faculty in English, Spanish and Mandarin while employed as an English teacher in Taiwan.

Iâ€™m excited to combine my years of international work experience with my new skills in Ruby on Rails, Javascript and React to a new opportunity as a developer.
